- use native tree-sitter API rather than the package (v0.11 not supported anymore)

- simplified test-result: The apex run test and apex get test commands now have a new --concise flag

- FIXME apex test run doesn't end the running flag
- FIXME main branch allows me to push commit directly

- add tests for non-UI
