## Prerequirements
- [Salesforce sf CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli)

## Install
Lazy.nvim

```lua
return {
  'xixiaofinland/sf.nvim',
  branch = 'main',

  dependencies = {
    "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
  },
}

```

## Usage

All public facing functions can be checked by `:h sf.nvim` or in [help.txt](https://github.com/xixiaofinland/sf.nvim/blob/dev/doc/sf.txt)

### Display target_org

When Nvim starts, Sf.nvim runs `SfFetchOrgList`(i.e. `sf org list`) to fetch the authenticated org names and save the target_org name in the plugin if it exists.
As a majority of commands execute against a target_org, it's recommended to set (use `SfSetTargetOrg`) and display target_org in your statusline.

For example, I use lualine.nvim, and configure/show target_org(`xixiao100`) as below.

```lua
    sections = {
      lualine_c = { 'filename', {
        "require'sf'.get_target_org()",
      } },
```

### Commands
Hotkeys and user commands are defined in the middle of this file [here](https://github.com/xixiaofinland/sf.nvim/blob/dev/plugin/sf.lua).

They are enabled ONLY when the current buffer is both:
- `apex`, `javascript`, or `html` filetype
- and in a sf project folder (i.e. has `.forceignore` or `sfdx-project.json` in the root path)

When both conditions are met, type `<leader>s` should see hotkeys as in the screenshot.

Type `:Sf` in Ex will list all user commands:
