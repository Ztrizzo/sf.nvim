<h1 align="center">CodeSnap.nvim</h1>
<p align="center">üì∏ Snapshot plugin that can make pretty code snapshots with real-time previews for Neovim</p>

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin is currently in its early stages and may have some bugs, please feel free to submit issues and PRs.

## ‚ú®Features
- üî• Real-time preview
- ü§© Beautiful code snap template
- üòé Custom watermark and window style
- üíª Mac style title bar
- üëè [WIP] Custom template background
- ü§ñ [WIP] Generate snapshot just one command
  

## Prerequirements
- Rust environment required for compiling codesnap.nvim plugin server source code, visit [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for more detail.

## Install
```lua
{ "mistricky/codesnap.nvim", build = "make" },
```

## Usage 
For take a screenshot, the `codesnap.nvim` provides a command named `CodeSnapPreviewOn` to open the preview page, and then you can switch to visual mode and select code you want, and finally just click the copy button on the preview page, that's all :)

https://github.com/mistricky/codesnap.nvim/assets/22574136/5e1a023e-142f-49e8-b24f-707da3728fd5

## Commands
```shell
CodeSnapPreviewOn # Open preview page

-- The following commands are planned but not implemented yet. (welcome PR :))
CodeSnap # Take a code snap and copy it into the clipboard
```

## Configuration
Define your custom config using `setup` function
```lua
require("codesnap").setup({...})
```

There is a default config:
```lua
{
    mac_window_bar = true,-- (Optional) MacOS style title bar switch
    opacity = true, -- (Optional) The code snap has some opacity by default, set it to false for 100% opacity 
    watermark = "CodeSnap.nvim", -- (Optional) you can custom your own watermark, but if you don't like it, just set it to ""
    preview_title = "CodeSnap.nvim", -- (Optional) preview page title
    editor_font_family = "CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font", -- (Optional) preview code font family
    watermark_font_family = "Pacifico", -- (Optional) watermark font family
}
```

# Sf.nvim

Offer common functionalities for Salesforce development

# Install

Lazy.nvim

```lua
return {
  'xixiaofinland/sf.nvim',
  branch = 'main', -- use dev branch for cutting-edge features

  dependencies = {
    "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
  },
}

```

About the dependencies:
 - `nvim-treesitter` includes Apex parser and syntax highlight. There is no reason you don't install it at the first place. It's also used in sf.nvim to identify Apex test class/menthod.
 - `telescope.nvim` is only used in `SfRetrieveMetadata` and `SfRetrieveMetadataType` to fuzzy search metadata. You can leave it out if these two functions are not in use.

# Modules

- `SFOrg`  The module to interact with Salesforce org.
- `SFTerm` The module to run commands in an integrated floating terminal.
- `SFMd`   The module to deal with metadata and metadata-type.
- `SFTest` The module to facilitate test running.

Tip: You can read help.txt [here](https://github.com/xixiaofinland/sf.nvim/blob/main/doc/sf.txt), or use `:h SFOrg`, `:h SFTerm`, `:h SFMd`, and `:h SFTest` in Nvim to see more details.

# Usage

## Hotkeys and User commands

Hotkeys and user commands are defined [here](https://github.com/xixiaofinland/sf.nvim/blob/365ae4cedd5ea6cd78f4206153d8cc4f148cfb77/plugin/sf.lua#L53).

They are enabled ONLY when the file in the current buffer is:
- `apex`, `javascript`, or `html` filetype
- and in a sf project folder (i.e. has `.forceignore` or `sfdx-project.json` in the root path)

When both conditions are met, type `<leader>s` should see hotkeys as in the screenshot.

Type `:Sf` in Ex will list all user commands:

## Display target_org

When Nvim starts, sf.nvim auto-runs `SfFetchOrgList` to fetch the authenticated org names and save the target_org in `require'sf'.target_org`.
As a majority of commands execute against a target_org, it's wise to display target_org in your statusline.

For example, I use lualine.nvim, and configure/show target_org(`sandbox1`) as below.

```lua
    sections = {
      lualine_c = { 'filename', {
        "require'sf'.target_org",
      } },
```

## Some often used commands

- `SfSetTargetOrg` set a target_org by choosing from authenticated org names
- `SfDiff` diff the file content between local and target_org version in side-by-side windows
---------------
- `SfToggle` toggle the integrated floating terminal window
- `SfSaveAndPush` save the current file and push to target_org
- `SfRetrieve` retrieve the current file from target_org
- `SfCancelCommand` Terminate the running command in the integrated terminal
---------------
- `SfRunAllTestsInThisFile` run all Apex tests in the current file
- `SfRunCurrentTest` run the Apex test under the cursor
- `SfRepeatTest` repeat the previous test command
- `SfOpenTestSelect` open a top-window with Apex test list of the current file
